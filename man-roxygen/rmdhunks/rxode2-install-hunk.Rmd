You can install the released version of rxode2 from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {.r}
install.packages("rxode2")
```

You can install the development version of rxode2 with

``` {.r}
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2parse")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2random")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2et")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2ll")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2")
```

To build models with rxode2, you need a working c compiler. To use
parallel threaded solving in rxode2, this c compiler needs to support
open-mp.

You can check to see if R has working c compiler you can check with:

``` {.r}
## install.packages("pkgbuild")
pkgbuild::has_build_tools(debug = TRUE)
```

If you do not have the toolchain, you can set it up as described by the
platform information below:

### Windows

In windows you may simply use installr to install rtools:

``` {.r}
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
install.rtools()
```

Alternatively you can
[download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and install
rtools directly.

### Mac OSX

To get the most speed you need OpenMP enabled and compile rxode2 with
that compiler. There are various options and the most up to date
discussion about this is likely the [data.table installation faq for
MacOS](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation#openmp-enabled-compiler-for-mac).
The last thing to keep in mind is that `rxode2` uses the code very
similar to the original `lsoda` which requires the `gfortran` compiler
to be setup as well as the `OpenMP` compilers.

If you are going to be using `rxode2` and `nlmixr` together and have an
older mac computer, I would suggest trying the following:

```r
library(symengine)
```

If this crashes your R session then the binary does not work with your
Mac machine.  To be able to run nlmixr, you will need to compile this
package manually.  I will proceed assuming you have `homebrew`
installed on your system.

On your system terminal you will need to install the dependencies to
compile `symengine`:

```sh
brew install cmake gmp mpfr libmpc
```

After installing the dependencies, you need to reinstall `symengine`:

```r
install.packages("symengine", type="source")
library(symengine)
```

### Linux

To install on linux make sure you install `gcc` (with openmp support)
and `gfortran` using your distribution's package manager.

## Development Version

Since the development version of rxode2 uses StanHeaders, you will need
to make sure your compiler is setup to support C++14, as described in
the [rstan setup
page](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started#configuration-of-the-c-toolchain).
For R 4.0, I do not believe this requires modifying the windows
toolchain any longer (so it is much easier to setup).

Once the C++ toolchain is setup appropriately, you can install the
development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/nlmixr2/rxode2) with:

``` {.r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2parse")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2random")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2et")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2ll")
devtools::install_github("nlmixr2/rxode2")
```
