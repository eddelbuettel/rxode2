# Facilities for generating R shiny applications

An example of creating an
R [shiny application](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to interactively
explore responses of various complex dosing regimens is available at
http://qsp.engr.uga.edu:3838/rxode2/RegimenSimulator.  Shiny
applications like this one may be programmatically created with the
experimental function `genShinyApp.template()`.

The above application includes widgets for varying the dose, dosing
regimen, dose cycle, and number of cycles.

```

genShinyApp.template(appDir = "shinyExample", verbose=TRUE)

library(shiny)
runApp("shinyExample")

```

# Exploring parameter fits graphically using shiny

An rxode2 object can be explored with `rxShiny(obj)`.  `rxShiny()` will also allow you to try 
new models to see how they behave.
