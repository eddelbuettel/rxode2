As suggested in the name, rxode2 is often concerned with solutions to
ordinary differential equations.  The syntax of the ODE models is
covered in the [rxode2 syntax vignette](rxode2-syntax.html)

You can create other types of models with rxode2:

- Prediction only models without ODE systems in them (`$PRED` models
  in NONMEM).
- 1, 2 and 3 solved compartment models (`ADVAN/TRANS` in NONMEM).
- Mixing any of these items with ODE systems.
