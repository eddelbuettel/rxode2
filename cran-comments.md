# CRAN Comments

The following platforms were tested with a succesful check: MacOS release, Windows
  release, ubuntu devel, and ubuntu release.
  
Also the win-builder was checked and ran successfully.

* This fix allows log-likelihood estimation in nlmixr2

* I have also checked campsis and the checks are OK.

* All the rest of the packages are nlmixr2 related packages and will
  be submitted shortly.  The new versions also work with this version
  of rxode2.
